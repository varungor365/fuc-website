# 🛠️ Profile Service Deployment Fix

## Issue Summary

The p.fashun.co.in profile service was failing to deploy on Vercel with the following error:

```
Running "install" command: `cd fashun-store && npm install`...
sh: line 1: cd: fashun-store: No such file or directory
Error: Command "cd fashun-store && npm install" exited with 1
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by Vercel trying to deploy the profile service (p.fashun.co.in) but using the wrong build configuration:
1. Vercel was configured to use the root [vercel.json](file:///d:/fuc-website-main/vercel.json) which was set up for the main store (www.fashun.co.in)
2. The build command was trying to navigate to [fashun-store](file:///d:/fuc-website-main/fashun-store) directory which doesn't exist in the context where p.fashun.co.in is being built
3. According to project configuration, p.fashun.co.in should use [./profile-service](file:///d:/fuc-website-main/profile-service) as the root directory

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Vercel Configuration for Profile Service

Added [profile-service/vercel.json](file:///d:/fuc-website-main/profile-service/vercel.json):
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

### 2. Added Deployment Ignore File

Created [profile-service/.vercelignore](file:///d:/fuc-website-main/profile-service/.vercelignore):
```
node_modules
.git
*.md
.env
.env.local
```

### 3. Updated Root Vercel Configuration

Modified root [vercel.json](file:///d:/fuc-website-main/vercel.json) to use a smart build script that can handle both services:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "vercel-build.bat",
  "installCommand": "echo \"Install handled by build script\"",
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/shop",
      "destination": "/collections/all",
      "permanent": true
    },
    {
      "source": "/privacy",
      "destination": "/privacy-policy", 
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Created Smart Build Scripts

- [vercel-build.bat](file:///d:/fuc-website-main/vercel-build.bat) - Smart build script that detects which service to build based on domain
- [build-profile-service.bat](file:///d:/fuc-website-main/build-profile-service.bat) - Dedicated build script for profile service

## Verification

✅ **Profile Service Builds Successfully**
```
> fashun-profile-service@1.0.0 build
> next build
   ▲ Next.js 14.1.0
   - Environments: .env.local
   Creating an optimized production build ...
 ✓ Compiled successfully
```

✅ **All Components Functioning**
- Homepage renders correctly
- User profile pages work with dynamic routing
- API endpoints respond properly
- Click tracking functions as expected

## Deployment Instructions

### For Vercel Dashboard:

1. **Create New Project for p.fashun.co.in**
   - Project Name: `fashun-profile-service`
   - Root Directory: `profile-service`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://p.fashun.co.in
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STORE_URL=https://www.fashun.co.in
