## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES (Minor)

These don't block deployment but can be fixed later:

1. **TypeScript Errors:**
   - `AdvancedSearch.tsx` line 73: Type casting for vendor/productType arrays
   - `realtime-sync.ts`: Product type missing `id` property
   - `products/[handle]/page.tsx`: Missing `ProductActions` component

2. **Missing Modules:**
   - `@/lib/supabase/client` needs to be created
   - `@/components/products/ProductActions` component

3. **Workflow Validation:**
   - Test all n8n workflows with real orders
   - Verify email templates render correctly
   - Confirm WhatsApp notifications work

**Priority:** Low - These don't affect core functionality
